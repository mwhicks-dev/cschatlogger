* Introduction

## Introduction

CSChatLogger is part of a larger project I am working on in order to practice service-oriented architecture/microservices and software architecture. The service allows for authenticated accounts to create one-on-one or group chats where they can send and recieve text-based messages (albeit unencrypted). This doesn't do anything revolutionary, but it is mine. As the name suggests, I am developing this component in C#.NET.

## Known issues and limitations

For now, messages and data transfer are unencrypted. Of course, they will be encrypted by your database of choice if you choose for them to be.
